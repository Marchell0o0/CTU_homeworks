# Repository Overview

This repository contains various programming projects across different subjects. Each subject focuses on a specific theme or topic. Below is a brief description of each subject.

## ALP (Algorithms and Programming)

Introductory Computer Science course in Python. Projects in related to algorithmic problem solving, including sequence analysis, number system operations, date conversion, chessboard evaluation, matrix manipulation, and figure placement. The semestral work is a TRAX board game player.

## PRG (Programming in C)

Engineering focused C language. Work related to memory allocation and multi-threated programming. Projects focused on programming concepts, such as ASCII art, prime factorization, Caesar cipher, grep implementation, matrix operations, and data structure implementation. The semestral work is a multi-threaded fractal drawing program.

## KUI (Cybernetics and Robotics)

AI and decision-making algorithms course in Python. Projects exploring artificial intelligence techniques, including A* algorithm for maze-solving, Reversi player using minimax with alpha-beta pruning, Markov Decision Process, and reinforcement learning for policy in a maze.
