# Short descritption of every project

1. Simple object-based implementation of the A* algorithm for solving mazes.
2. Two functions that are used to create Markov Decision Policy for a maze, one is using value iteration, other policy iteration.
3. Function that creates a policy for a maze using reinforcement learning.
4. Main file is player.py which is a minimax with alpha-beta prouning based player for a board game reversi.

# Testing

Can't provide any testing instructions because the homework required all programs to have the functions of the algorithms, and no code with the visualizations.
